# InvestiKid — Deployment Environments

Single source of truth for how InvestiKid promotes code from development to real users.
Supersedes the branch/env notes in `deployment-checkpoint.md` (which now only documents the
manual checkpoint workflow).

## The three environments

| Env | Branch | Purpose | Database | Audience | iOS/Android |
|-----|--------|---------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Testing** | `testing` | Build & validate every new feature | **Separate test DB — a snapshot of prod** | You | Built **on demand only** |
| **Staging** | `staging` | Promote what passed testing; beta channel | Prod-like / restricted prod data | **Selected beta-testers only** | Built on demand |
| **Production** | `main` | The live app | Production | Everyone (after beta) | TestFlight / App Store |

**Promotion flow:** build on `testing` → promote to `staging` for beta-testers → promote to
`main` for everyone. Promote by fast-forwarding the branch (`git checkout staging && git merge
--ff-only testing && git push`, then the same `staging → main`).

## How deploys actually happen

- **GitHub Actions (`ci.yml`)** only *validates* — frontend, backend, security, a11y, responsive.
  It runs on push to `main`, `staging`, `testing` and on PRs into `main`/`staging`. It is
  **ubuntu-only**: it never builds iOS or Android, so it doesn't burn macOS minutes.
- **Vercel** deploys the frontend via its own Git integration, per branch (see `frontend/vercel.json`).
- **Railway** deploys the backend via its own Git integration, per branch/environment.
- **iOS/Android** are built **only** by the manual **Deployment checkpoint** workflow
  (`Actions → Deployment checkpoint → Run workflow`), with explicit `run_ios` / `run_android`
  toggles (default off). Nothing native builds automatically.

## Repo configuration that supports this (already in place)

- `frontend/vercel.json` → `git.deploymentEnabled`: `main: false` (production = **manual
  promotion**), `staging: true`, `testing: true`.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` → triggers on `main`/`staging`/`testing`; GitHub-environment name
  resolves `main`→`production`, `staging`→`staging`, else `testing`.
- `.github/workflows/deployment-checkpoint.yml` → `target_environment` choices `testing` /
  `staging` / `production`; production checkpoints are guarded (must run from `main` + require
  notes). Opt-in `run_ios` / `run_android`.
- `backend/railway.json` → start command runs `alembic upgrade head` then seed then uvicorn.
  ⚠️ See the staging migration note below.

## What YOU configure on the platforms (one-time)

These need dashboard access and are not in the repo.

### Vercel
1. Import `ashmorel/investikid`; **Root Directory = `frontend`**.
2. Branch → environment:
   - `testing` → Preview (auto-deploys; `vercel.json` enables it).
   - `staging` → Preview, **protected** (Deployment Protection / password / SSO so only your
     beta-testers can reach it).
   - `main` → Production, **auto-deploy disabled** (`vercel.json` `main: false`); you click
     **Promote to Production** after beta sign-off.
3. Set per-environment env vars (`VITE_API_BASE_URL`, `VITE_WEB_ORIGIN`, `VITE_*` social IDs)
   pointing each env at its matching Railway backend.

### Railway
1. Create environments `testing`, `staging`, `production`.
2. Map each to its branch; **enable auto-deploy on `testing`/`staging`, keep `production`
   manual / approval-gated** (matches manual promotion).
3. **Testing DB = a snapshot of the current prod DB** (prod holds only test data today). Give
   testing its own database + test-only secrets.
4. Per-env vars: `ENVIRONMENT`, `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `CORS_ORIGINS`, `APP_BASE_URL`,
   `CRON_SECRET`, etc.
5. **Staging migration safety:** if staging ever points at the live production database, do **not**
   run schema migrations against it. Either disable deploy-time `alembic upgrade head` for the
   staging service or point staging at a production-clone/rehearsal DB. (`railway.json`'s start
   command migrates on every deploy — override it per-environment for staging.)

### GitHub
1. `Settings → Environments`: create `testing`, `staging`, `production`.
2. Protect `production`: required reviewers + deployment branch restricted to `main`.
3. Restrict `staging` deployment branch to `staging`.
4. Add any environment secrets CI needs.

### iOS (TestFlight)
- `cd frontend && npm run build && npx cap sync ios` (already run for the current `main`),
  then open `ios/App` in Xcode, archive, and upload to TestFlight. Signing/certs are yours.
- For a CI-built artifact instead, run the **Deployment checkpoint** workflow with `run_ios=true`.

## Security pre-public checklist (before making the repo public)
- Rotate any secrets that were ever tracked (the old monorepo tracked `frontend/.env.production`)
  and rotate `CRON_SECRET`.
- Confirm no `.env*` is tracked here (only `backend/.env.example` should be) and run `gitleaks`.
- Enable GitHub secret scanning.
